        "conversation_history": "Tutor:  Hi, could you please provide a step-by-step solution for the question below? The question is: Julia was preparing for a dinner party at her house, where she intended to serve stew.  She noticed that she was out of plastic spoons, so she bought a new package of spoons.  Later, her husband also bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.  While Julia was making the stew, she used three of the spoons to sample her stew.  Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons.  How many spoons were in the package that Julia bought? \n Student: Let's call the number of spoons Julia bought \"x\". \nHer husband bought 5 more spoons, so the total number of spoons is now x + 5. \nJulia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so she had 12 - 3 = 9 spoons left. \nWe know that the total number of spoons is x + 5, so we can set up an equation: \n\nx + 5 = 9 \n\nSubtracting 5 from both sides: \n\nx = 4 \n\nSo Julia bought a package of 4 spoons. \n 4 \n Tutor: please talk me through your solution \n Student: Sure. I started by letting x be the number of spoons Julia bought. Then I added 5 to x to get the total number of spoons. Next I subtracted 3 from the total number of spoons to get the number of spoons left. Finally I set up an equation and solved for x which was 4. So Julia bought a package of 4 spoons. \n Tutor: Okay -  you've overcomplicated this. Let's start again. We know Julia has 12 spoons when setting the table. We also know she used three whilst sampling her stew. How many is that altogether? \n Student: 12 - 3 = 9. So Julia had 9 spoons left when setting the table.",

In this case, the least common multiple of 4 and 5 is 20. So, we need to convert both fractions to have a denominator of 20.\n\nFor 3/4, multiply the numerator and denominator by 5 to get 15/20. For 2/5, multiply the numerator and denominator by 4 to get 8/20.\n\nNow that both fractions have a common denominator, we can add them together: 15/20 + 8/20 = 23/20.\n\nSince 23/20 is an improper fraction, we can convert it to a mixed number by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 23 ÷ 20 = 1 with a remainder of 3.\n\nTherefore, the sum of 3/4 and 2/5 is 1 3/20.\n\nDoes this explanation help you understand how to add fractions with different denominators?",

If Rehana is currently 25 years old, and Jacob, Rehana's brother, is 3/5 of Phoebe's current age, how old is Jacob now? \n Student: Let's start by finding how old Phoebe will be in five years when Rehana is three times as old. If Rehana is currently 25, in five years she will be 25+5 = 30 years old.\nIf in five years Rehana will be three times as old as Phoebe, Phoebe will be 1/3 of Rehana's age, which is 30/3 = 10 years old.\nIf Jacob is currently 3/5 of Phoebe's age, he is 3/5 x 10 = 6 years old.\n 6 \n Tutor: How old is Phoebe NOW? \n Student: Phoebe is currently 25 - 3/5 x 25 = 15 years old.",

The question is: Before Marcus went on a road trip to LA, his car had 1728 miles on it. He filled his empty gas tank twice and used up all the gas on the trip. If Marcus's car gets 30 miles per gallon and holds 20 gallons of gas, how many miles does Marcus' car have on it now? \n Student: On the first fill-up, Marcus used 20 x 30 = 600 miles worth of gas.\nOn the second fill-up, Marcus used another 20 x 30 = 600 miles worth of gas.\nBefore the trip, Marcus had 1728 miles on his car. During the trip, he used up 600 + 600 = 1200 miles worth of gas.\nTherefore, Marcus' car now has 1728 - 1200 = 528 miles on it.\n 528 \n Tutor: You are very close! \n Student: What am I missing?",

The question is: Taylor and his friends decide to bring their pets together for a walk. 3 of his friends come first, each having twice as many pets as Taylor has. Another two of his friends have 2 pets each. If Taylor has 4 pets, what's the total number of pets they have together? \n Student: Taylor's 3 friends each have 2 x 4 = 24 pets altogether.\nSo, the three friends have a total of 3 x 24 = 72 pets altogether.\nThe other two friends have 2 x 2 = 4 pets altogether.\nTherefore, Taylor and his friends have a total of 4 + 72 + 4 = 80 pets altogether.\n 80 \n Tutor: Hey Student this look like a tough question, how do you think you have done? \n Student: I think I got the right answer, but I'm not sure if my reasoning is correct. I used a calculator to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.",
